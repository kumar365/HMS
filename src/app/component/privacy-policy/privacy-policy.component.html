                                                your account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you
                                                the Services. We shall not retain such information for longer than is

                                                provide our Services effectively, but our use of the anonymized data
                                                will be solely for analytic purposes. Please note that your withdrawal
                                                of consent, or cancellation of account may result in AidXpert being
                                                unable to provide you with its Services or to terminate any existing

                                            <p>xi) If you wish to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications such
                                                as promotional and marketing-related information regarding the Services,

                                            <p>xii) AidXpert may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire
                                                transfer, debit card or cheque for Services for which subscription
                                                amount(s) is/are payable. AidXpert will collect such User’s credit card
                                                number and/or other financial institution information such as bank
                                                account numbers and will use that information for the billing and
                                                payment processes, including but not limited to the use and disclosure
                                                of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary
                                                to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information,
                                                however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication
                                                process. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon
                                                secure sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under
                                                encryption, thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per
                                                current technology. However, AidXpert provides you an option not to save
                                                your payment details. User is advised, however, that internet technology
                                                is not full proof safe and User should exercise discretion on using the
                                                same.</p>
                                            <p>xiii) Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or
                                                the End-User or anyone who visits the Website, AidXpert automatically
                                                receives the URL of the site from which anyone visits. AidXpert also
                                                receives the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s computer (or
                                                the proxy server a User used to access the World Wide Web), User’s
                                                computer operating system and type of web browser the User is using,
                                                email patterns, as well as the name of User’s ISP. This information is
                                                used to analyze overall trends to help AidXpert improve its Service. The
                                                linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally identifiable
                                                information is not shared with or disclosed to third parties.
                                                Notwithstanding the above, AidXpert may share and/or disclose some of
                                                the aggregate findings (not the specific data) in anonymized form (i.e.,
                                                non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors,
                                                strategic partners, and others in order to help grow its business.</p>
                                            <p>xiv) The Website uses temporary cookies to store certain (that is not
                                                sensitive personal data or information) that is used by AidXpert and its
                                                service providers for the technical administration of the Website,
                                                research and development, and for User administration. In the course of
                                                serving advertisements or optimizing services to its Users, AidXpert may
                                                allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on
                                                the User's browser. The cookies however, do not store any Personal
                                                Information of the User. You may adjust your internet browser to disable
                                                cookies. If cookies are disabled you may still use the Website, but the
                                                Website may be limited in the use of some of the features.</p>
                                            <p>xv) A User may have limited access to the Website without creating an
                                                account on the Website. Unregistered Users can make appointments with
                                                the doctors by providing their name and phone number. In order to have

                                                first create an account on our Website. To create an account, a User is
                                                required to provide the following information, which such User
                                                recognizes and expressly acknowledges is Personal Information allowing
                                                others, including AidXpert, to identify the User: name, User ID, email
                                                address, country, ZIP/postal code, age, phone number, password chosen by
                                                the User and valid financial account information. Other information
                                                requested on the registration page, including the ability to receive
                                                promotional offers from AidXpert, is optional. AidXpert may, in future,
                                                include other optional requests for information from the User to help

                                            <p>xvi) AidXpert does not exercise control over the sites displayed as
                                                search results or links from within its Services. These other sites may
                                                place their own cookies or other files on the Users’ computer, collect
                                                data or solicit personal information from the Users, for which AidXpert
                                                is not responsible or liable. Accordingly, AidXpert does not make any

                                            <p>xvii) The Website may enable User to communicate with other Users or to
                                                post information to be accessed by others, whereupon other Users may
                                                collect such data. Such Users, including any moderators or

                                                AidXpert, and they are not authorized to bind AidXpert to any contract.
                                                AidXpert hereby expressly disclaims any liability for any reliance or
                                                misuse of such information that is made available by Users or visitors
                                                in such a manner.</p>
                                            <p>xviii) AidXpert does not collect information about the visitors of the

                                            <p>xx) AidXpert has implemented best international market practices and
